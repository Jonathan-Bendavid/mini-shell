# mini-shell
This project is a Windows-based mini-shell written in C that replicates fundamental shell behavior. It features a command loop, built-in command handling, external program execution, and output redirection. The project was developed to deepen understanding of operating system concepts such as process creation, standard I/O handling, and command parsing.
